                                Jason Lind has been on the bleeding edge of technology and organizational theory since he became an equity partner at GeoCities in 1996. He started at Marquette University majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a minor in Political Science as a Sophomore at age 16 in 2001. Leaving with Junior Standing at the end of 2002 he began a software consulting practice that immediately took him to the F500 with Fortis Health Insurance where Naval Captain Roger J Jones encouraged him to enlist in the USAF. After passing Basic Military Training in 2004, Jason entered a long avionics technical school and after 11 months of training the USAF and him mutually parted ways with a General Under Honorable discharge.
                                </p><p>
                                In 2008 Jason co-founded Lind Innovation, first as President / Chief Software Architect and then starting in 2011 as Executive Vice President / Chief Strategy Officer, to be a beacon of innovation in an increasingly risk adverse world and achieved significant success consulting in the F500 community with a specific emphasis on Financial Institutions. Along the way he co-founded several major organizations including NexDevices: a consumer focused hardware packaging and software development firm to create next-generation consumer experiences. In 2018 Jason co-founded Transformation.run, as the Executive Vice President for Transformation, which has rapidly stood up as a formable organization on the marketplace.
                            </p><p>
                                The founder of the concept of Transformation Engineering, Jason has a differentiating wide and deep combination of technical and business skill sets that are an asset to any organization or project.
