He started at Marquette University majoring in Electrical and Computer Engineering with a minor in Political Science as a Sophomore at age 16 in 2001. Leaving with Junior Standing at the end of 2002 he began a software consulting practice that immediately took him to the F500 with Fortis Health Insurance where Naval Captain Roger J Jones encouraged him to enlist in the USAF. After passing Basic Military Training in 2004, Jason entered a long avionics technical school and after 11 months of training the USAF and him mutually parted ways with a General Under Honorable discharge.

                                In 2008 Jason co-founded Lind Innovation, first as President / Chief Software Architect and then starting in 2011 as Executive Vice President / Chief Strategy Officer, to be a beacon of innovation in an increasingly risk adverse world and achieved significant success consulting in the F500 community with a specific emphasis on Financial Institutions. Along the way he co-founded several major organizations including NexDevices: a consumer focused hardware packaging and software development firm to create next-generation consumer experiences. In 2018 Jason co-founded Transformation.run, as the Executive Vice President for Transformation, which has rapidly stood up as a formable organization on the marketplace.
